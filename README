= Signal IPC
Example in using SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 for inter-process communication.

== Description
A process is forked, a string is read in, and then sent to the child. 
The transmission is conducted while reading the chars in the string bitwise and encoding 0 as the process signal SIGUSR1 and 1 as SIGUSR2.

This is just an example in learning processes and IPC.
